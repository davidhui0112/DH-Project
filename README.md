    Hello, The One Who Concerning Your Own Health!

    <h1>David Intelligent Healthcare Limited</h1>

<p>Our company, David Intelligent Healthcare Limited is the data science start-up company who has the vision of enhancing the accessibility for patients and doctors 
    in Hong Kong Healthcare Industry. </p>
    
    <p>We believe that "Better access and communication between patients and doctors should have positive effect to the healthcare ecosystem." </p>

    <p>Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is one of the top chronic disease in the world. 
      The worldwide diabetic patients have reached 382 million in 2013 and predicted that the prevalence will increase 55% in 2035. 
      Also, it claimed that every 6 to 10 seconds, one death exists (Lukmanto & Irwansyah, 2015).</p>
    
    <p>DM is the disease that the pancreas doesnâ€™t produce insulin to convert glucose. 
      Then, excessive glucose in the bloodstream will trigger different severe complications or life-threatening health problems such neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy. 
      There are two types of DM: insulin-dependent DM (Type 1 Diabetes or called T1D) and non-insulin-dependent DM (Type 2 Diabetes or called T2D). 
      Approximately 90% of patients have T2D (Chaki et al., 2020 & Kavakiotis et al., 2017).</p>
